<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
I am currently a graduate student from Vision Information Discovery And Recovery (VIDAR) group at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. Zhiwei Xiong. I received my bachelor's degree at Ocean University of China (OUC) in 2021.  My research interests focus on image/video enhancement, image/video generation and inverse tone mapping.

 
I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position for the Fall semester of 2024. If there are any available positions, I would be grateful for the chance to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your consideration.
