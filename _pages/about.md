<!-- <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2> -->
I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student from  [SmileLab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/) at Northeastern University (NEU), supervised by [Prof. Yun Raymond Fu](https://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu). Before that, I received my Master's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Zhiwei Xiong](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zwxiong/).  I received my Bachelor’s degree at Ocean University of China (OUC) in 2021.

My research interests focus on adaptive and interpretable computational photography, with a strong interest in 3D scene reconstruction, image/video enhancement, and interactive tasks.
